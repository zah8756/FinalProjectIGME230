# FinalProjectIGME230

For my final project, I plan on creating a simple button game in which the object is to find the button on each screen. The game will consist of three different mini-game each with eh intention of finding the button. In the first level will be the simple ball and 3 three cups game but with a twist, the ball isn't under the cups in is under the table.For the second screen will need to move objects from the middle of the screen till you find a zipper containing the button.For the final screen, you will see a Christmas tree with a squirrel inside the tree your objective is to trade something with the squirrel to obtain the button to do this you will need to open presents till you find an acorn. To create this small game I am planning to use anime.js to create a track and keyframe for my objects, I am also planning to use jquery to make the objects draggable.If the leveldesign becomes to much I can also create many diffrent types of simple puzzels becasue of how broad the concept is.
